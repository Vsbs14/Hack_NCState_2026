      <p>Last Saturday I noticed a steady drip from the kitchen faucet that had been getting worse over the past week. Rather than call a plumber, I decided to take a crack at it myself. I'd never done faucet repair before, but it turned out to be way more straightforward than I expected.</p>

      <p>Our faucet is a Moen single-handle pull-down model that's about seven years old. A quick search told me the most likely culprit was a worn-out cartridge. Moen makes replacement cartridges that are pretty easy to find at any hardware store.</p>

      <h3>What I needed</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Moen 1225 replacement cartridge ($24 at the local hardware store)</li>
        <li>Adjustable wrench</li>
        <li>Flat-head screwdriver</li>
        <li>Plumber's grease</li>
        <li>Old towel</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The process</h3>
      <p>First thing: turn off the water supply valves under the sink. I also turned on the faucet to release any remaining pressure. Then I put the towel in the sink to catch small parts.</p>

      <p>Removing the handle was the trickiest part, mainly because the set screw was hidden under a small decorative cap. I used the flat-head screwdriver to gently pry it off. Once the screw was out, the handle lifted right off.</p>

      <p>The retaining nut came off with the adjustable wrench. Then I pulled the old cartridge straight up and out. You could see the wear on the rubber seals — that was definitely the source of the leak.</p>

      <p>I applied a thin layer of plumber's grease to the new cartridge, slid it in, and reassembled everything in reverse order. The whole thing took about 35 minutes, including the time I spent watching a YouTube video to make sure I was doing it right.</p>

      <div class="note">
        One thing to watch out for: make sure you orient the new cartridge the same way as the old one. There's a small tab that needs to line up with a notch in the faucet body. If it's wrong, the hot and cold will be swapped.
      </div>

      <h3>Result</h3>
      <p>No more drip. Honestly feels good to have fixed something around the house without having to pay someone $150+ for what ended up being a pretty simple repair. The cartridge has a limited lifetime warranty from Moen too, so if it fails again they'll replace it free.</p>

      <p>If your Moen faucet is dripping, I'd say give it a try before calling a plumber. Just take your time with the set screw and you'll be fine.</p>
